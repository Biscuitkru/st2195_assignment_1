# Assignment 1

This is the Jupyter Notebook Markdown document of Assignment 1 where we were tasked to create a Python script that prints integers between 1 and 10 with an extra point awarded if a for loop was used.


```python
for x in range (1,11):
    print(x)
```

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
    


```python
print(*range(1,11))
```

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
